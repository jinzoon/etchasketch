# Game Boy Sketch Pad (Etch-a-Sketch Clone)

A pixel-style sketchpad built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch — with a Game Boy twist. As you move your mouse over the grid, each square fills in with Game Boy green, increasing in opacity on each pass until fully filled. Create custom-sized grids with the click of a button.

This project was created as part of the [Foundations section of The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Game Boy Color Palette Used

| Element        | Color                |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Background     | `rgb(155,188,15)`    |
| Grid outline   | `rgb(15,56,15)`      |
